# Abstraction
Abstraction program 
Abstraction hiding the complexity 
abstract methods can be declared inside abstract classes
abstract methods normal methods too
a class which which extends abstract class should implement all the methods declared inside abstract class 
if it fails to do so we should make the extending class as abstract class
we cannot create an object of abstract class
abstract methods allow you to declare a method and further a class which extends abstract class can define it
